# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

## Welcome to the Complete Guide

This comprehensive guide covers the complete journey from digital AI to Physical AI, focusing on humanoid robotics systems that operate under real-world physical laws. You'll learn how to create intelligent systems that bridge the gap between artificial intelligence and physical embodiment.

## What You'll Learn

This book covers 12 comprehensive chapters that take you through:

- **Foundation**: Understanding Physical AI principles and humanoid robot systems
- **ROS 2 & Control**: Mastering robot operating system and control mechanisms
- **Simulation & Environment**: Creating realistic simulation environments with Gazebo, Unity, and NVIDIA Isaac
- **Navigation & Mapping**: Implementing SLAM and autonomous navigation systems
- **AI & Perception**: Developing vision-language-action systems for intelligent interaction
- **Capstone Project**: Building a complete autonomous humanoid system

## Key Concepts

### Physical AI vs. Digital AI
Physical AI systems operate under real-world constraints:
- Real-time processing requirements
- Physical laws and limitations
- Energy consumption constraints
- Safety and reliability requirements
- Sensor and actuator limitations

### Embodied Intelligence
The complete loop: **Sensors → AI → Actuators** enables:
- Learning through physical interaction
- Real-world adaptation and robustness
- Natural human-robot interaction
- Context-aware decision making

### MCP-Grounded Development
All technical content is grounded using Context7 MCP Server documentation to ensure accuracy and prevent hallucinations, following the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book Constitution requirements.

## Getting Started

Navigate through the chapters using the sidebar to explore each topic in depth. Each chapter builds upon previous concepts while providing practical implementation examples using ROS 2, simulation environments, and real-world robotics applications.

Start with [Chapter 1: Introduction to Physical AI](./01-introduction-to-physical-ai/intro-to-physical-ai.md) to begin your journey into Physical AI and humanoid robotics.
